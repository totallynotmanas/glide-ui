# Glide-UI: A Modern GUI for Glide

## Overview

Glide-UI is a sleek and modern graphical user interface (GUI) built for the [Glide](https://github.com/ngpal/glide) application, developed by [@ngpal](github.com/ngpal). Designed using the [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) framework in Python, Glide-UI brings a responsive and interactive experience to terminal-based user interfaces. The project aims to provide an intuitive way to interact with Glide while maintaining a lightweight and efficient implementation.

## Features

- **Built with Textual**: Leverages the power of Textual to create a dynamic and responsive TUI (Text User Interface).
    
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work with `glide-server` (v1.0.3), ensuring smooth compatibility.
    
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Optimized for performance without unnecessary bloat.
    
- **Themed Styling**: Uses `glideui.tcss` for custom styling, making the interface visually appealing.
